I recently moved back home to Malden, MA, since I'll be working this summer in Cambridge at ITA software.

I decided that as part of my getting back to making music, I'd make a home recording studio in my room over the summer as I get more money. just today (or technically yesterday) I got my computer and monitor for it. They are supposed to be dedicated to music.

Anyways, enough with the rambling- As my first experiment, I spent a couple hours making a dubstep track. It's not complete, but that's why it was an experiment.

It gets dirty about halfway in:

<notextile>
<p id="audioplayer_1">Dubtest</p>  
<script type="text/javascript">  
AudioPlayer.embed("audioplayer_1", {soundFile: "/media/music/Ryan Clough- Dubtest.mp3"});  
</script> 
</notextile>
"Download MP3 Here":/media/music/Ryan%20Clough-%20Dubtest.mp3
