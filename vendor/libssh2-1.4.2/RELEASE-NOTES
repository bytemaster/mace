libssh2 1.4.2

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o Return LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_DISCONNECT on EOF when reading banner
 o userauth.c: fread() from public key file to correctly detect any errors
 o configure.ac: Add option to disable build of the example applications
 o Added 'Requires.private:' line to libssh2.pc
 o SFTP: filter off incoming "zombie" responses
 o gettimeofday: no need for a replacement under cygwin
 o SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST: default to want_reply
 o win32/libssh2_config.h: Remove hardcoded #define LIBSSH2_HAVE_ZLIB

This release would not have looked like this without help, code, reports and
advice from friends like these:

 Alexander Lamaison, Rafael Kitover, Guenter Knauf, Peter Stuge,
 Oleksiy Zagorskyi
 
        Thanks! (and sorry if I forgot to mention someone)
