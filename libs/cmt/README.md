Boost.CMT - Cooperative Multitasking Library
---------------------------------------

This library builds on top of Boost.Context to provide 
an effecient coopertive multitasking API with a focus 
on ease of use and staying out of your way.

Some of the key features include:

  1. Lock-free inter-thread communication.  
  2. Waiting on boost::signal
  3. Propagation of exceptions to wait() caller.
  4. Minimial useage of heap, synchronous inter-thread calls do not allocate on heap.
  5. Actor Paradigmn support via Boost.Reflect's any_ptr<T>

Boost.CMT can be built by checking out my development repository: https://github.com/bytemaster/dev

### Installation ## 

    git clone https://github.com/bytemaster/mace
    cd mace
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cmake .
    make
    make install
    @endcode

### Notice ###

  This library is not part of the official Boost C++ library, but
  is written, to the best of my ability, to follow the best practices
  established by the Boost community and with the hope of being 
  considered for inclusion with a future Boost release.

### Warning ###
  This code is in early alpha phase.  I welcome feedback and help in
  defining the scope of this library.  

### Requirements ###
    
 This code has been tested on Mac OS X using gcc 4.5.3 and boost 1.47

 1. Boost.Context is included.
 2. Boost.Atomic is included.
 3. Boost.Reflect is required for using Actors


### Basic Example ###

    int hello(const std::string& world ) {
        return world.size(); 
    }

    int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
        ptime start = microsec_clock::universal_time();
        int sum = 0;
        for( uint32_t i = 0; i < 1000; ++i ) 
            sum += async<int>( boost::bind(hello, "world"), "hello_func" ).wait();
        ptime end = microsec_clock::universal_time();
        slog( "%1% calls/sec", (1000.0/((stop-start).total_microseconds()/1000000.0)) );
    }

### Signal Example ###

    boost::signal<void(std::string)> test_signal;
   
    void delay()
    {
        cmt::usleep(2000000);
        test_signal("hello world!");
    }

    int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
         async( delay );
         std::cerr<<cmt::wait(test_signal);
    }
