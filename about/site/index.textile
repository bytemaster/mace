h1. Site Info

This website is "Open Source":http://github.com/RyanCacophony/becomingaweso.me

h3. The Name

I believe Awesome
to be the journey, and not
the destination.

In all of my doing,
my goal: Awesome. Thus I am
*(med)Becoming Awesome*.

h3. Philosophy

I realize it probably seems strange for a personal website to have a "philosophy," but this site *(med)was* designed with some goals in mind.

In the creation of this site, I strived for simplicity and control. From the layout of the site down to the OS involved (which I was already using, but hey, it fits! ;D), it is small, simple, and powerful.

The result is a static site, with a minimalist layout. Hopefully one you don't have to think too much about using.

h3. Server

h4. Location

This server is currently located in my apartment at RIT. It has a (theoretically) 100/10mbit link, which I find more than suitable for now. In the future I may go with slicehost or ask CSH for a VM (but I'd have to take the time to create an Arch Linux image :P)

h4. Specs

The server is custom built by me. It has a quad core AMD running at 2.4ghz per core, with 4GB of RAM. It runs "Arch Linux":http://archlinux.org x86_64. Pages are served to you by the lovely i"Nginx":http://nginx.net/.

h3. Site Generation

This site is generated by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll. The content for the site is marked up in "Textile":http://textile.thresholdstate.com/ or is written in XHTML by hand


h3. Layout/CSS

The layout was designed and written out by me in "LessCSS":http://lesscss.org/.

h3. Other Tools

The entire site was written in "Vim":http://www.vim.org/, through "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, through "Awesome WM":http://awesome.naquadah.org or "screen":http://www.gnu.org/software/screen, on "Arch Linux 64":http://archlinux.org/. <3 terminal.
