h1. Contact Me

My username across every site is *(med)RyanCacophony*. If you want to contact me, your best bet is via email (I have *(med)Gmail*; You're smart enough to figure out the username), but if you're lucky you can find me on the likes of AIM, MSN, et cetera.

If you're into the social media jive, you can find me on "Facebook":http://facebook.com/rclough, "Twitter":http://twitter.com/RyanCacophony, and "Github":http://github.com/RyanCacophony.

The truly cutious will be able to find me in other places too...
