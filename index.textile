h1. What's new?

If you came here looking for Ryan Clough, You've come to the right place!

My website is now back after an "explosive":/blog/code/Explosions/ situation. It's now running on a "private VPS":http://fsckvps.com, so I don't have to worry about hardware blowing up anymore.

I've just recently opened up this website, so feedback on my design would be
wonderful!
