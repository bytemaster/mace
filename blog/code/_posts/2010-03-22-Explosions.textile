h1. The Skinny

I just finished my reading for CS Theory on finite automata and other such delights. I decided to take a little break and lay in my bed to somenice slow jazz tunes before I head off to Break Dance club.

I'm relaxing there, when I hear, in the living room, maniacal laughter from my roommate Eric Koslow.

I head out to see what was so hilarious.

My computer/webserver/mediaserver/general workhorse *(med)exploded*.

Sparks, smoke and all.

The PSU was hot as hell as well as the CPU. The PSU is assuredly toasted, and I've ordered a new one. Hopefully that is the last of my worries.

In the mean time, I'm thanking god for revision control and Git Hub, as I push my site over to GitHub pages in the meantime.

None of you probably noticed the downtime, but I figured a story about explosions is good in anyones book.

Another page for my book of crazy life stories.
